# SCSA: cell type annotation for single-cell RNA-seq data
Currently most methods take manual strategies to annotate cell types after clustering the single-cell RNA-seq data. Such methods are labor-intensive and heavily rely on user expertise, which may lead to inconsistent results. We present SCSA, an automatic tool to annotate cell types from single-cell RNA-seq data, based on a score annotation model combining differentially expressed genes and confidence levels of cell markers in databases. Evaluation on real scRNA-seq datasets that SCSA is able to assign the cells into the correct types at a fully automated mode with a desirable precision.<br><br>

## Output explanation
The output information from stdout consists of five parts: "#Cluster","Type","Celltype","Score","Times"

“#Cluster” : the cluster id from input file.

“Type” : A subjective symbol for the predictio results.

   “Good” means one of the following conditions:
       1.Only one celltype found
       2.The score of the first predicted celltype is more than twice as much as the second predicted celltype.
       3.The score of the second predicted celltype is a minus.

   “?” means the score of the first predicted celltype is less than twice as much as the second predicted celltype.

   “E” means no celltype found.

“Celltype”: The predicted celltype name.

“Score” : The predicted score for a celltype normalized by Z-score method. “nan” will be assigned if only one celltype found. 

“Times” : The score of the first predicted celltype / The score of the second predicted celltype
